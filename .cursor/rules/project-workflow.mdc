## Rule 3: Memory Bank Maintenance - MANDATORY

**CRITICAL**: After EVERY SINGLE PROMPT, you must check if the memory bank needs updates and update it immediately if needed.

### Memory Bank Files:
Located in `memory-bank/` directory:
- `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document
- `productContext.md` - Product vision and user experience
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md` - Technology stack and setup
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus (MOST LIKELY TO NEED UPDATES)
- `progress.md` - Project status and what's completed

### Update Triggers:
Update memory bank files when:
1. **Task completion**: When a task is finished, update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md`
2. **New decisions made**: Document in `activeContext.md` or `systemPatterns.md`
3. **Architecture changes**: Update `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`
4. **New features added**: Update `productContext.md` if user experience changes
5. **Technical changes**: Update `techContext.md` for new dependencies or tools
6. **Status changes**: Update `activeContext.md` for current focus, `progress.md` for completion status

### Update Process:
1. **After every prompt response**, before finishing:
   - Review what changed in the conversation
   - Identify which memory bank files need updates
   - Update ALL relevant files immediately
   - Be thorough - better to over-document than under-document

2. **Priority files to check every time**:
   - `activeContext.md` - Current work focus, recent changes, next steps
   - `progress.md` - What's completed, what's left, current status

3. **When in doubt**: Update the memory bank. It's better to have redundant information than missing information.

### Update Quality:
- Be specific and detailed
- Include context and rationale for decisions
- Update timestamps or status indicators where relevant
- Cross-reference related information across files

**Rationale**: The memory bank is the AI's only link to previous work after session resets. It must be maintained with precision and completeness to ensure continuity.

## Workflow Summary

For every user interaction:
1. ✅ Read `finsight-ai_tasks.md` to understand current priorities
2. ✅ Work on tasks in sequence from the task list
3. ✅ Never run git commands
4. ✅ Update `finsight-ai_tasks.md` if tasks need to change
5. ✅ After completing work, update memory bank files (especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`)
6. ✅ Before finishing response, verify memory bank is up to date

These rules are NOT negotiable and must be followed strictly.
